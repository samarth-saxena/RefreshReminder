# Refresh Reminder 
## Your digital health monitor 

Refresh Reminder helps users improve not only their physical health but in turn their work productivity by giving them a soft nudge in the form of reminding the user to take timely breaks and notifying them about possible lapses in eye blinking and facial distance. It also suggests the optimal exercises via our AR model. The application can be accessed by motion gestures thus keeping the user away from their digital devices. 

## Features

### Screen to face distance tracker

The application sets a baseline for the ideal distance you should be from your monitors, and then tracks your face in real-time. If you sit too close to the screen, a warning pops up and you can adjust yourself accordingly, reducing the strain on your eyes.

### Blink detection

Every blink moistens the eyes, and dry eyes are painful and harmful. Healthy blinking is about 20-25 blinks per minute, but while working with screens, it goes down to 7-10 bpm. Our app warns you if this is happening with you, ensuring you and your eyes remain refreshed.
