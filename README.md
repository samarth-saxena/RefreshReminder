# Refresh Reminder 
## Your digital health monitor 

Refresh Reminder helps users improve not only their physical health but in turn their work productivity by giving them a soft nudge in the form of reminding the user to take timely breaks and notifying them about possible lapses in eye blinking and facial distance.
