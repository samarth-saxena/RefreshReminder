# Refresh Reminder 
## Your digital health monitor 

Refresh Reminder helps users improve not only their physical health but in turn their work productivity by giving them a soft nudge in the form of reminding the user to take timely breaks and notifying them about possible lapses in eye blinking and facial distance. It also suggests the optimal exercises via our AR model. The application can be accessed by motion gestures thus keeping the user away from their digital devices.
